%
% Package:  maple2e 
%
% This package defines the latex macros used by "Export to LaTeX" and 
% "Export to techexplorer".  It makes use of several sub-packages.
% 
% mapleenv - Maple Environments used to mark mapleinput, mapleoutput,
% mapletab - Maple Macros to display tables (spreadsheets)
% mapleplots - Maple macros to display plots.
%
% See the comments in maplenv.sty for a more detailed discussion of
% the special environments such as
%
%	\begin{mapleinput} ... \end{mapleinput}
%	\begin{maplelatex} ... \end{maplelatex}
%
% and for details about macros such as
%
%	\mapleinline <status> <type> <verbatim code> <latex code>
%	\maplemultiline{ ... }
%
% which are used to control style and to embed raw Maple data.
% 
% USAGE:
%
%	To use this package, add the line  
%
%	\usepackage{maple2e} to 
%
%	your document preamble.  If you are using a specific plot
%	driver such as dvipsone, then add its name as an option as
%	in:
%
%	\usepackage[dvipsone]{maple2e}
%
%	The default option value is "dvips".
%
%	If you wish to preview your document, ignoring plots, use
%	the "noplots" option.
%
%	The only options available are precisely those needed to
%	control plotting.  Plots are handled by the standard LaTeX2e
%	graphics package and for LaTeX are restricted to postscript.
%	 
% NOTES:
%
%	It is an easy extension of this code to other plot file formats.
%	All that is needed is a new definition of \mapleplot
%	to invoke the graphics code of your choice.
%
%	To adjust the spacing around the Maple environemnts, edit
% 	change the entries in the file mapleenv.def
