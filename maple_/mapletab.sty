%%% Maple Spreadsheets and Tables Package
%%%
%%%  Maple displays its spreadsheets as a tabular arrays of cells.
%%%
%%% This is essentially a tabular environment
%%% with some pre and post processing. 
%%% The format is:
%%% \begin{maplespreadsheet}[spreadsheet01.tab]{|c|c|}
%%% \hline
%%% entry 1 &
%%% entry 2 &
%%% \mapleinline{inert}{2d}{1;}{xx} \\
%%% \hline
%%% entry 2,21 &
%%% entry 2,3  &
%%% \mapleinline{{1;} \\
%%% \hline
%%%\end{maplespreadsheet}
%%%
%%%  The cells are in typeset in text mode. The mathematics is
%%%  usually provided in \mapleinline in order to provide both the
%%%  Maple and the LaTeX encoding of the expression.
%%%
%%%  Maple's \multiline macro is used in the latex portion
%%%  of the \mapleinline macro in order to effect line wrapping.

%%% maplemultiline - Used for stacking lines of maple input and output
%%%
%%% An implementation of mapleinline based on vbox and hbox.

%%% Each line of the multiline is followed by some extra space
%%% No extra space is required at the top as the multiline is
%%% used inside of \mapleinline, which provide's its own space
