% These macro definitions are included by mapleenv.sty
%
% They control most of the spacing surrounding the standard 
% Maple environments.  This file provides the default values, but
% they are all resettable in the preamble of your document. 
% 
% \AboveMapleSkip	- space above an environment
% \BelowMapleSkip	- space below an environment
% \AboveMaplePlot	- space above a Maple Plot 
% \BelowMaplePlot	- space below a Maple Plot
% \MaplePlotHeight	- vertical space reserved for a plot
% \MaplePlotWidth	- width reserved for a plot
% \MaplePlotAngle	- angle of rotatation
% \LeftMapleSkip 	- the amount of left indentation
% \MapleFont 		- The Maple font 
% \MapleSize 		- The size of the Maple font in mapleinput and 
%                          maplettyout
% \MapleLatexSize	- The size of the Maple fonts in maplelatex
% \MapleFirstLine	- controls ingoring first line feed
% \MaplePrompttrue 	- controls insertion of prompt char
% \MaplePromptString	- defines the prompt string
% \MaplePromptSecondary	- defines the secondary prompt string
% \MapleSkip		- amount of glue before and after
%			displayed text
% \MapleTab		- number of spaces per tab (8)
%
% Spacing, dimensions, etc.
